README for omfs_fuse 
Bob Copeland <me@bobcopeland.com>

This is a reference implementation of the Optimized MPEG File System
using FUSE (File System in Userspace).  OMFS is a proprietary file 
system developed by SonicBlue and used by the Rio Karma and ReplayTV.

There is also a native Linux out-of-tree filesystem driver written
by myself.  The kernel driver is currently about 60% faster than this
FUSE implementation. Unlike the kernel driver, omfs_fuse has improved 
handling of continuation inodes, has a better block allocation algorithm,
supports ReplayTV filesystems with little-endian disk formats, and 
doesn't require building and installing a kernel module.

To use:
    $ omfs [opts] -a <device-file> <mount-point>   # mount a device
    $ fusermount -u <mount-point>                  # unmount

The filesystem is by default mounted read-write, but write support is
still somewhat experimental.  Use the "-o ro" mount option to enable 
read-only mode.
