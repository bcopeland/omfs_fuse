README for fuseomfs

This is a reference implementation of the Optimized MPEG file system
using FUSE (File System in Userspace).  This is mostly intended as an
experimental tool for testing and correctness rather than as an optimized,
full-fledged implementation for every day use (use my native kernel driver
for that).

To use:
    $ omfs -a <device-file> <mount-point>   # mount a device
    $ fusermount -u <mount-point>           # unmount

OMFS now automatically swaps blocks if the magic number is little-endian.
This will enable ReplayTV 4xxx and 5xxx series devices to work without 
special compilation.

At present the FS is read-write, but don't expect it to do the write portion
correctly yet.  You can use the "-o ro" mount option to enable read-only mode.
