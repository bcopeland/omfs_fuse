README for fuseomfs

This is a reference implementation of the Optimized MPEG file system
using FUSE (File System in Userspace).  This is mostly intended as an
experimental tool for testing and correctness rather than as an optimized,
full-fledged implementation for every day use (use my native kernel driver
for that).

To use:
    $ omfs -a <device-file> <mount-point>   # mount a device
    $ fusermount -u <mount-point>           # unmount

To use with ReplayTV 4xxx-5xxx, build like this:
    $ CFLAGS=-DRTV_HACK make

(At some point I'll make that mount-time configurable.)

At present the FS is read-only.
